## Case Study 1

1. Write classes to hold Account, SB-Account and Current-Account details. Here implements the concept of inheritance]. The common properties of the account are Account number, name and amount.Specifics of SB account is 4% interest to be paid per month.   
* Implement the run-time polymorphism by creating base class variable and derived class object.   
* Ask the user for which type of account to be created then create the correspondingaccount (Note: Use scanner class).   
* Implement function overriding by having deposit and withdraw functions and  
* perform the required action accordingly.Ensure base class canâ€™t be instantiated.    
(Note: Abstract keyword can be used).    

2. Define the minimum balance for the both the type of accounts. Use final keyword tocreate constants.Ensure sb account class and current account class will cannot be used as base classes (Note:You can use final classes).

## Case Study 2 

__Domain__: Area Calculation  

__Statement__: Once the admission process got over the students were expected in their Maths class to calculate area of bounded figures. These bounded figures included are of Circle, Square and Rectangle etc. A few of these students planned to create a Java Program for performing this Mathematical Calculation but they wanted to create a Program to for Maximum Readability. So, they decided to use just one function name for calculating areas of all these figures. So, help the students to find out the solution for this problem.
